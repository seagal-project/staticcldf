"""
Script for building a static CLLD site.

This script can be used both locally and for various integration services,
including Netlify.

There is no command-line argument parsing, at least for the time being, as
the entire configuration is supposed to take place through JSON files.

Upon deployment, previous files are not deleted: success in new generation
and deployment should be checked by the user from the script return codes.
